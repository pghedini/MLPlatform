In this tutorial we will **setup a platform from scratch** to experiment with **Python** and **Machine Learning tools**. What you will need:
- an host enabled to run Virtual Machines
- or an host with a USB memory key of adequate dimension to store a linux distro (at least 2GB)

In order to make simple the setup we will use the **"Fedora Python Classroom"** an excellent linux distro with a preinstalled lot of useful tools.

The tutorial is also an introduction to simple Machine Learning techniques. In particular we will use a well known classifier called **"RandomForestClassifier"** to try to predict if a passenger of the famous **TITANIC** will survive to the shipwreck or not. As the manual says the RandomForestClassifier is "a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting."
